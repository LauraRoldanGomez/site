## **Laura Roldan-Gomez**

PhD Candidate in Advanced Quantitative Methods

Centre for Computational Social Science (C2S2), University of Exeter

<br>

Hello and welcome to my academic website! 

My name is Laura, and I am PhD Candidate in Advanced Quantitative Methods at the University of Exeter's [Centre for Computational Social Science](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/research/centres/computational-social-science/). My current research focuses on the relationship between armed conflict in Colombia and deforestation, using innovative network analysis methods.

I am passionate about studying social-ecological systems and using network analysis to understand complex relationships between nature, individuals, groups, and institutions. Through my research, I hope to contribute to a greater understanding of the ways in which human actions and societal structures interact with and impact the natural world.

Please feel free to explore my website to learn more about my research interests, publications, and ongoing projects. 

Thank you for visiting!
