## Policy - Strategy - Engagements
- War is an instrument of policy
- Strategy - mechanism bridging political aim with military means to achieve the goal of war
- Military means - acts of war or 'engagements' to defeat the enemy completely or enough to make them stop fighting.

## Main argument: 
any conflict is the aggregation of confrontations... so, we can look into the mycrodynamics of war to better understand why wars prolongate. 


## Prediction:

The dynamics change over time:
- ... at the beginning of the conflict, we will see more tit-for-tat <br>

- ... then we'll see the escalation to attrition and maneouvering strategies
<br>

- ... for the most part, one of these two microdynamics will dominate over the other

# Conclusion

# Conclusion

- At the beginning of the conflict we see a *tit-for-tat strategy* and you can see on the graph how it is sometimes not clear which strategy is dominating, *Reciprocity* is as high as inertia

- Then, there is a or multiple culmination points after which we can see the death spiral escalation of conflict and we see a progression into a *maneouvering/attrition strategy* which then seems neverending... it fails.
<br>

- After which, we see a spike in *Inertia* dominating the rest of the history of events

<br>

## So what?

- Can we predict when conflict will go from tit-for-tat to attrition?
- Can we combine REM with machine learning to train these models?
- Can we resolve conflicts earlier?
- Are Clausewitz theories of interstate war written in the 1830's applicable to today's civil wars?
- Is a Relational Event Model able to help see what Clausewitz posed almost 300 years ago?

## Limitations

! Unknown direction of attacks between paramilitary groups and rebel groups - Data was imputed using a Bernoulli distribution
<br><br>

! The intensity of the conflict was lower at the beginning and probably, the data was also more sparse

! I don't know how to replicate this study

# Extra parameters to measure time dependence
Further exploration of inertia and reciprocity

- Recency or the tendency of recent contacts to become future contacts - the more recent in the past, the more likely in the future 
<br><br>

- Participation Shifts or ‘moment-by-moment shuffling’ of roles: attackers and targets. If it is the last action, how much likely is it going to be your next action

# Reciprocity

.pull-left[

<br><br>

- Overall, armed groups do not tend to reciprocate attacks

<br>

- There seems to be a tendency to reciprocate recent attacks, but not over the whole war

<br>

- Armed groups tend to avoid reciprocating attacks
