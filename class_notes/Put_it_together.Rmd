# Today's Tasks:

# Building the outline:

This example, based on my research, demonstrates how you can begin structuring the skeleton of your text and organising your ideas for your own projects. It is a good exercise that will help you develop your research proposal. 

Try it yourself, and don‚Äôt get stuck on selecting the perfect theory‚Äîresearch is an evolving process, and you can refine your approach as you progress.
