**Today:** 
Work on choosing the topic and refining the question 

<br><br>

# Choose a Topic 💡

**Exercise:** If you don't have a topic yet, you can go to [My notes for Week 3](https://lauraroldangomez.github.io/site/class_notes/Put_it_together.html#31_Politics) and choose a topic from the list. Of course, you can choose topics that are not on that list, these are just suggestions.

# Narrow Down the Topic and Draft Your Question 📝 

**Exercise:** Answer 5 times the question "What" 🔄  

  1. **What** is my topic:  Conflict  
  2. **What** about Conflict: Civil Conflict  
  3. **What** about Civil Conflict:  Duration of Civil Conflict  
  4. **What** about the Duration of Civil Conflict: Long-lasting civil conflicts  
  5. **What** about Long-lasting civil conflicts: What are the factors that increase the duration of civil conflicts❓

📌 **Templates:**  

Use these question structures to refine your research inquiry:

	•	“What is the relationship between ___ and ___?”
	•	“To what extent does ___ affect ___?”
	•	“How has ___ changed over time?”
	
<br><br>

# Define the Boundaries of the Topic 🔍

**Exercise:** “5Ws and H” Approach: What, When, Where, Why, How, and Who  

Ask yourself questions to refine your focus. Some may be practical, like **"Where do I get data from?"** Try answering the ones you can! ✅  

**❓ What**
- What are Civil Conflicts?
- What are long-lasting Civil Conflicts?
- What are the factors that fuel civil conflicts?

### **⏳ When**  
- When did these conflicts happen?  
- What is my timeframe? *I will concentrate on Civil Conflicts after World War II*  

### **🤔 Why**  
- Why do some conflicts last longer than others?  
- Why is it important to know this?  

### **🌍 Where**  
- Where are these civil conflicts taking place?  
- Where am I going to focus my study? *South America*  
- Where do I find the data?  

### **📊 How**  
- How do I want to analyse this? **Qualitatively or Quantitatively?**  
- How do long-lasting conflicts affect countries?  

### **👥 Who**  
- Who are the actors involved in long-lasting conflicts?  
- Who knows about civil conflicts?

# Alternative Approach  🔄

Need a different approach? Try the **PICO framework** (often used in social sciences and health research, but adaptable for politics).  

	•	**P**opulation  
	•	**I**ntervention  
	•	**C**omparison  
	•	**O**utcome  

📌 **Example:**  

- **P**opulation: UK voters  
- **I**ntervention: Brexit campaign  
- **C**omparison: No Brexit campaign  
- **O**utcome: Change in public opinion

# The “So What?” Test  🤔  

This exercise helps **justify the importance** of your topic!  

**Activity:** State your research question, then ask, **“So what?”** until you clarify its significance.  

📌 **Example:**  

🔹 **Question:** “What are the factors that increase the duration of civil conflicts?”  
	- **So what?** “Long-lasting conflicts have devastating consequences”  
	- **So what?** “By knowing the factors that fuel conflicts, we can change policies of de-escalation and peace-building”

# Twist and Turn: Reframe Your Question 🌀 

Frame your draft question in different ways.

**Example:**  

**What are the factors that increase the duration of civil conflicts?**  

	•	“What is the relationship between the duration of civil conflicts and the environment?”  
	•	“To what extent does a long-lasting civil conflict affect the environment?”  
	•	“How has the duration of conflicts changed over time?”
